# CALCULATOR
A calculator is used to perform mathametical operations quickly.

Your task is to implement a calculator that will take a string representing a sum or equation as input, parse the input, then return the correct result to the user. 

Your second task is to refactor your design in order to pass the two sets of unit tests. Additionally you may need to add additional unit tests to demonstrate correct functionality as could be expected of a calculator.

## REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY
The calculator should be able to:
 * Perform simple arithmetic operations (+ - * /) on a series of up to 2000 instructions of the same precedence
 * Handle values up to the limits of a 32-bit signed integer value
 * Throw an appropriate exception, with an appropriate error message, if an error occurs during the processing
 * Decimal answers should be truncated to a maximum of five decimal places for display to the user

### HINTS
 * Consider the underlying data structre to use in the calculator class
 * For the advanced functionality, read up on Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) as this may make complex equations easier to process

### EXAMPLES
Please see the unit tests.
